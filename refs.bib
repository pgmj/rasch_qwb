	abstract = {A new type of nonnormality correction to the RMSEA has recently been developed, which has several advantages over existing corrections. In particular, the new correction adjusts the sample estimate of the RMSEA for the inflation due to nonnormality, while leaving its population value unchanged, so that established cutoff criteria can still be used to judge the degree of approximate fit. A confidence interval (CI) for the new robust RMSEA based on the mean-corrected (“Satorra-Bentler”) test statistic has also been proposed. Follow up work has provided the same type of nonnormality correction for the CFI (Brosseau-Liard \& Savalei, 2014). These developments have recently been implemented in lavaan. This note has three goals: a) to show how to compute the new robust RMSEA and CFI from the mean-and-variance corrected test statistic; b) to offer a new CI for the robust RMSEA based on the mean-and-variance corrected test statistic; and c) to caution that the logic of the new nonnormality corrections to RMSEA and CFI is most appropriate for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, and cannot easily be generalized to the most commonly used categorical data estimators.},

	abstract = {Scale validation is vital to psychological research because it ensures that scores from measurement scales represent the intended construct. Factor analysis fit indices are commonly used to provide quantitative evidence that a proposed factor structure is plausible. However, there is mismatch between guidelines for evaluating fit of factor models and the data that most researchers have. Namely, fit guidelines are based on simulations assuming item responses are collected on a continuous scale whereas most researchers collect discrete responses such as with a Likert-type scale. In this paper, we show that common guidelines derived from assuming continuous responses (e.g., RMSEA {\textless} 0.06, CFI {\textgreater} 0.95) do not generalize to factor models applied to discrete responses. Specifically, discrete responses provide less information than continuous responses, so less information about misfit is passed to fit indices. Traditional guidelines therefore end up being too lenient and lose their ability to identify that a model may have poor fit. We provide one possible solution by extending the recently developed Dynamic Fit Index framework to accommodate discrete responses common in psychology. We conduct a simulation study to provide evidence that the proposed method consistently distinguishes between well-fitting and poorly-fitting models. Results showed that our proposed cutoffs maintained at least 90\% sensitivity to misspecification accuracy across studied conditions whereas traditional cutoffs were highly inconsistent and frequently exhibited sensitivity below 50\%. The proposed method is included in the dynamic R package and as a web-based Shiny application to make it easily accessible to psychologists.},

	abstract = {Researchers and clinicians are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of assessing positive functioning to inform clinical outcomes. This paper evaluates the Questionnaire on Well-Being (QWB, available for free https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GSC3R), a clinically informed instrument that assesses subjective well-being, across two studies. Study One, consisting of treatment-seeking individuals in an assertiveness training sample (n = 495), explored the factorial structure of the QWB, assessed the four-week test-retest reliability, criterion-related validity, and identified a preliminary cutoff point for the QWB with clinical significance. Study Two, including participants from the general public (n = 1561), confirmed the factorial structure of the QWB and further evaluated criterion-related validity. The results provided support for a unidimensional structure for the QWB. Furthermore, the QWB exhibited excellent internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.93 and 0.94 in Study One and Two, respectively), high test-retest reliability (ICC3 = .50 at a four-week follow-up in Study One), and appropriate criterion-related validity demonstrating positive correlations with positive affect and negative correlations with psychopathology. Finally, a cutoff point on the QWB below 50 was associated with marked psychopathology. These findings provide preliminary support for the usage of the QWB in clinical and non-clinical settings, establishing the QWB as a reliable indicator of subjective well-being.},
